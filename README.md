# Grocery-Delivery
A full-featured grocery delivery web application that allows users to browse products by category, add items to their cart, choose a delivery address, and securely checkout online using Stripe. The application is built with modern web technologies like React.js, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to provide a smooth, responsive, and real-time user experience. In addition to customer features, the platform includes a dedicated seller/admin panel where sellers can add new grocery items with images, edit or delete existing products, and view all customer orders.
